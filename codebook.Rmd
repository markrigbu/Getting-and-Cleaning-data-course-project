Getting data of Human Activity from accelerometers and gyroscopes within Samsung Smartphones and cleaning the data into a Tidy Dataset
========================================================

Mark Rigby


Background
-----------

From 30 volunteers wearing Samsung Galaxy S II phones containing accelerometers and gyroscopes, six activities were monitored:
* Walking
* Walking downstairs
* Walking upstiars
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

The metrics; 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were measured at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, 70% of the volunteers into the training data and 30% into the test data.


Data Transformations
--------------


* The training and the test sets were merged to create one data set.
* Only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were selected. 
* The activity names (listed above) were used to describe the to name the activities in the data set
* The column labels were cleaned to provide readable descriptive variable names. 
* A second, 'tidy data' set was created with the average of each variable grouped by the activity and subject id - motion_data.txt


Variable names
---------------

* subject = the id of the volunteer, reffered to in the subjecttest.txt and subjecttrain.txt files
* activity = a description of theexercise performed by the subject (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
* All other variables describe either means or standard deviations of different metrics measured and processed by the acceerlometers and gyroscopes in the samsung phones.
